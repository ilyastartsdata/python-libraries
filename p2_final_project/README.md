## Credit Default

Geekbrains Python for Data Science course competition

> About Geekbrains: We teach people to master programming, web design and marketing from the ground up. We conduct online courses with internships and free master classes, develop the community, cooperate with employment companies and continuously test new methods to improve the effectiveness of learning.

## Overview

### Description

In this competition your task will be to predict the Credit Default in test.csv. You will be given two datasets: train.csv (contains all features and Credit Default) and test.csv (only features).

### Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is Mean F1-Score.

> The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good performance on both will be favored over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other.
